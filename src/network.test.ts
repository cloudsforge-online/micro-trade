/**
 * The network boundary, pinned.
 *
 * trade serves BOTH estates from one process since the network consolidation (micro-deploy
 * `docs/network-consolidation.md`). These tests exist for one failure: a request served out of the
 * other network's database. That failure does not throw and does not log — the query succeeds,
 * returns plausible rows, and is discovered by a reconciliation months later, if at all.
 *
 * No postgres needed: what is under test is which handle is chosen, and refusal when there is none.
